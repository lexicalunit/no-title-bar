Hides the Atom title bar on systems that support it. Make sure to enable **Use Custom Title Bar** in your **Core** Atom settings (`core.useCustomTitleBar: true` in your `config.cson`). This setting was first available in Atom Beta version 1.11.0.

- Limited to systems that support custom title bar, such as Mac OS for example.
- Interferes with the ability to drag tabs.
